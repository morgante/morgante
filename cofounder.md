How would you like to make $300 in 5 minutes?

I'm a software developer working on a FinTech startup and I need a cofounder, a people person who could sell a painting to a blind man. Business experience a must, experience in finance a plus. Soul, guts, and ambition required. Success not guaranteed.

Know the right guy or gal? Connect us (morgante.pell@morgante) and if they're the one you'll get $300 (and they'll get a whole lot more).
