Phase 1: Week 1
---------------

April 13, 2014 – April 19, 2014

# Reflection
This week was a decent start, but had some unfortunate mood swings over the weekend. These depressive episdes led to overeating, particularly on Saturday. Additionally, on Wednesday and Thursday I slept far too much (all afternoon) and missed my planned exercise.

However, not all was bad. In particular, I am happy about:

- Maintaing order on my to do list
- Following through on the commitment to not drink soda or eat ice cream (D1 and D2)
- Beginning to log all activity
- Maintaing a clean work environment

Recommended improvements and revisions include:

- Sleeping at least 6 hours a night. Required. Mandatory.
- Socialize more: have at least one social interaction per week.
- When I am feeling down, donate to UWC-USA.
- Pretend to be happy. It will help with everything.
- Work on ABCupid more.
- Explore spirituality. Spend 1 hour a week reflecting.
