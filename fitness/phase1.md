Fitness: Phase 1
----------------

This document describes my plans for improving and maintaining fitness in phase 1.

## Timeline
Phase 1 begins on April 13, 2014.

## Objectives

 - The objective of this program is to lower my weight from **275 lbs** to **185 lbs**.

## Methods
### Exercise

- E1: I will exercise for 30 minutes with a trainer on Tuesdays at 3:30pm.
- E2: I will exercise for 30 minutes with a trainer on Thursdays at 4:00pm.

### Diet

- D1: I will eliminate soda and soft drinks from my diet.
- D2: I will eliminate ice cream and frozen yogurt from my diet.
- D3: I will log all meals and caloric consumption.

### Mental Health

- H1: Ever Saturday at 5pm, I will spend 30 minutes in quiet contemplation.
- H2: Smile. Pretend to be happy.
- H3: When I am feeling unhappy, I will donate to UWC-USA.

### Misc.

- M1: I will sleep 6 hours a night. The latest I can stay up on a week night is 3am.
- M2: I will engage on social activity at least once a week. It cannot be school or work-related.

## Process
At the end of each week, a log will be written and committed to this repository. It will include information on my current weight, eating habits, exercise habits, and overall wellbeing.

It will make a holistic evaluation of my progress. If I am failing to progress towards my goals, this phase plan will be altered to improve my progress. If I am feeling good about progress, I will move to phase 2, which will be drafted to include additional methods of fitness improvement. Phase 2 will also be automatically triggered if my weight falls to 265 lbs.
