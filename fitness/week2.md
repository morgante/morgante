Phase 1: Week 2
---------------

April 20, 2014 â€“ April 26, 2014

## Sunday (April 20, 2014)

Today was a good day. Despite starting off slowly, not waking up until 3pm, I managed to turn it around and accomplish significant objectives.

In particular, I spent an extra 30 minutes exercising today in the fitness center, on the elliptical.

The biggest question going forward is how to stabilize my mood. Forced social interaction will likely play an important role in that. Maybe invigorate the board games SIG? I should also try sitting with people in the dining hall.

## Wednesday (April 23, 2014)

Today was quite unproductive. I spent most of the afternoon and evening just surfing the internet and reading Hacker News.

### Sleep
I went to sleep at 2:43am. I brought my laptop to bed and was watching videos immediately before sleeping.
