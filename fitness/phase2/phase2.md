Fitness: Phase 2
----------------

This document describes my plans for improving and maintaining fitness in phase 2, which is a reboot of the fitness program after a prolonged period of inattentiveness.

## Timeline
Phase 1 begins on June 30, 2014.

## Objectives

 - The objective of this program is to lower my weight from **275 lbs** to **185 lbs**.

## Methods
### Exercise

- E3: I will exercise for at least 1 hour every weekend.

### Diet

- D1: I will eliminate soda and soft drinks from my diet.
- D3: I will log all meals and caloric consumption.

### Mental Health

- H2: Smile. Pretend to be happy at all times.
- H3: When I am feeling unhappy, I will donate to UWC-USA.

### Misc.

- M1: I will sleep 6 hours a night. The latest I can stay up on a week night is 3am.
- M2: I will engage on social activity at least once a week. It cannot be school or work related.

## Process
At the end of each week, a log will be written and committed to this repository. It will include information on my current weight, eating habits, exercise habits, and overall wellbeing. This weekly review will be held on Sunday afternoon.

It will make a holistic evaluation of my progress. If I am failing to progress towards my goals, this phase plan will be altered to improve my progress. If I am feeling good about progress, I will move to phase 3, which will be drafted to include additional methods of fitness improvement. Phase 3 will also be automatically triggered if my weight falls to 250 lbs.
