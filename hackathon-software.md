While we will have a server available (insert link to directions here?),
participants are expected to have their own workspaces set up on their laptop.
Therefore, we ask that you install software you might use during the hackathon ahead of time.

Thus, we recommend you install some of the following software, depending on what projects you plan to work on.

* Throughout the conference, you will need a text editor which you are comfortable programming in. We recommend [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
* For mobile apps development on Android, check out [this guide](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html).
  * [The Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
  * [The ADT Plugin for Eclipse](http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html)
* For Python development, install the [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/)
* For web development, install [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html) for OSX or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) for Windows
* On OS X, we recommend installing [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), a package manager
* [Cloud9](https://c9.io/), a browser-based IDE

Although we have a server available for you to test your code on, teams are also free to use external services.
We recommend familiarizing yourself with:

* Heroku, a cloud development platform, which has many [development guides](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart):
 * [Python](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python)
 * [Ruby](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby)
 * [Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/), a version control system. This [guide](http://lifehacker.com/5983680/) will help you get started.
