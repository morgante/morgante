While we will have a [server available](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14OIMPtmcwEr4b7lBIoMWNdRLa_EF6VC0vWsbIcalYx4/pub), participants are expected to have their own workspaces set up on their laptop.
Therefore, we ask that you install software you might use during the hackathon ahead of time.

Thus, we recommend you install some of the following software, depending on what projects you plan to work on.

* Throughout the conference, you will need a text editor which you are comfortable programming in. We recommend [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
* On OS X, we recommend installing [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), a package manager
* For mobile apps development on Android, check out [this guide](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html).
  * [The Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
  * [The ADT Plugin for Eclipse](http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html)
* For Python development, install the [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/) and its [Eclipse plugin](http://pydev.org/manual_101_root.html)
* If you don't already have it, install the [Java Development Kit](http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/develop.xml).
* We recommend installing [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads) and [Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).
* For web development, install [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html) for OSX or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) for Windows
* [Cloud9](https://c9.io/), a browser-based IDE

Although we have a server available for you to test your code on, teams are also free to use external services.
We recommend familiarizing yourself with:
* Our server, which has directions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14OIMPtmcwEr4b7lBIoMWNdRLa_EF6VC0vWsbIcalYx4/pub).
* Heroku, a cloud development platform, which has many [development guides](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart):
 * [Python](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python)
 * [Ruby](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby)
 * [Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/), a version control system. This [guide](http://lifehacker.com/5983680/) will help you get started.
